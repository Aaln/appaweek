#Welcome to App-A-Week

##About

App A-Week is a special project to build an app every week. Whether it's a simple game of tic tac toe built in javascript doesn't matter, how I build it is non crucial to the goal. My hope is the quality of the apps improve over time as I get better.

### Week 1

This week I built 1000scientists at #YCHacks. The goal was to make it easier for scientists to collect training data for experiments. The current model widely used is mechanical turk, where you can pay someone else money to do mundane tasks.

The demo exists at scientists.herokuapp.com.
