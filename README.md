#Welcome to App-A-Week

##About

App-A-Week is a special project of mine to build an app every week. Whether it's a simple game of tic tac toe built in javascript- is non crucial to the goal. My hope is the quality of the apps improve over time as I get better.

Plus! All the apps I build for App-A-Week are open source. Feel free to take a look and use the code for good.

### Week 1

This week I built 1000scientists at #YCHacks. The goal was to make it easier for scientists to collect training data for experiments. The current model widely used is mechanical turk, where you can pay someone else money to do mundane tasks.

The demo exists at scientists.herokuapp.com
